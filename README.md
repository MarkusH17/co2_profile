# CO2 Profile for model greenhouse

A mathematical model for CO2 dispersion in a greenhouse is created using basic mass transport concepts. 

## Requirements
* Have Python 3.10+
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run `main.py`

## Assumptions
* Greenhouse is rectangular in shape and walls are impermeable
* Steady-state
* Pressure effects are negligible
* Modeled by a reactive and non-reactive zone
* Homogeneity by layer
